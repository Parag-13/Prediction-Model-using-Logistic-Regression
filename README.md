# Prediction-Model-using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to build a predictive model for classifying sonar signals as either rocks or mines using the SONAR dataset. The model is developed using a Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm, leveraging Python and scikit-learn for implementation.
